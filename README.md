# Brain
Brain is my personal assistant that turns any message or document I give it into clear tasks and deadlines in one place.

## v0 Scope (MVP)
- [ ] Paste text into a textarea
- [ ] Click "Process"
- [ ] Brain saves the text, calls an LLM to extract tasks + due dates
- [ ] Show all tasks in a simple list, sorted by due date

**Out of scope for v0**

- Integrations (Gmail, Motion, Notion, Calendar)
- Multi-user auth
- Notifications
- Fancy UI/animations
